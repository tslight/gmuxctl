* GMUX SWITCHER

From studying the Linux driver, the discrete power port may accept different
values on different models:

| Value  | Possible Meaning                    |
|--------+-------------------------------------|
| ~0x00~ | Full power off (what we want)       |
| ~0x01~ | Power on                            |
| ~0x02~ | Power on (alternate on some models) |
| ~0x03~ | Low power / D3 state?               |

If ~0x00~ doesn't work try:

#+BEGIN_SRC c
/* Try forcing GPU into D3 state first */
outb(GMUX_PORT_DISCRETE_POWER, 0x03);
usleep(100000);
outb(GMUX_PORT_DISCRETE_POWER, 0x00);
#+END_SRC
